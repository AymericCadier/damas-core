In order to make a smooth transition to the new specifications for servers versions > 2.3.3, we provide a `damas-legacy.js` module to connect to server-php versions < 2.3.x.

The `damas.js` module contains the up-to-date client for the new specifications, compatible with the latest versions of servers. It is not depdendant on prototypejs anymore
