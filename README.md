## Usage
Choose a server to run (either the Php or the NodeJS server) and use the Python or Javascript libraries to access it.

The NodeJS server is currently under development. For stable versions (currently Php only) please have a look at the releases. For a full Python compatible API, use the 2.2-stable release.
